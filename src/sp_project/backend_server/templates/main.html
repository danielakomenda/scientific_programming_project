                    As part of our scientific programming module, our team completed a Python project that involved collecting and analyzing real-life weather and energy-production data in Switzerland.
                    We aimed to understand the relationship between energy-production and weather, with the ultimate goal of predicting future energy-production based on weather predictions.

                    On this Webapplication you can find our results, so please feel free to visit all the Subpages to see, what we worked on.

                    In the navigation-bar, you can find graphics and interpretation about weather and energy-generation as well as a prediction fo future energy-generation based on the weather-prediction.
                    In the tab "Extras", you can find something fun, that has nothing to do with the rest of the Project.
